                    <p>There was a country where they were all thieves.</p>

                    <p>At night everybody would leave home with skeleton keys and
                    shaded lanterns and go and burgle a neighbour's house. They'd get
                    back at dawn, loaded, to find their own house had been robbed.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="float">
                    <p> So everybody lived happily together, nobody lost out, since each
                    stole from the other, and that other from another again, and so on 
                    and on until you got to a last person who stole from the first. Trade
                    in the country inevitably involved cheating on the parts both of
                    buyer and seller. The government was a criminal organization that
                    stole from its subjects, and the subjects for their part were only
                    interested in defrauding the government. Thus life went on smoothly,
                    nobody was rich and nobody was poor.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="float">
                    <p>One day, how we don't know, it so happened that an honest man
                    came to live in the place. At night, instead of going out with his
                    sack and his lantern, he stayed home to smoke and read novels.</p>
                
                    <p>The thieves came, saw the light on and didn't go in.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="float">
                    <p>This went on for a while, then they were obliged to explain to him
                    that even if he wanted to live without doing anything, it was no
                    reason to stop others from doing things. Every night he spent at
                    home meant a family would have nothing to eat the following day.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="float">
                    <p>The honest man could hardly object to such reasoning. He took to
                    going out in the evening and coming back the following morning
                    like they did, but he didn't steal. He was honest, there was nothing
                    you could do about it. He went as far as the bridge and watched
                    the water flow by beneath. When he got home he found he had been robbed.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="float">
                    <p>In less than a week the honest man found himself penniless, he had
                    nothing to eat and his house was empty. But this was hardly a problem,
                    since it was his own fault; no, the problem was that his behaviour
                    upset everything else. Because he let the others steal everything he
                    had without stealing anything from anybody; so there was always someone
                    who got home at dawn to find their house untouched: the house he should
                    have robbed. In any event after a while the ones who weren't being robbed
                    found themselves richer than the others and didn't want to steal any more.
                    To make matters worse, the ones who came to steal from the honest man's house
                    found it was always empty; so they became poor.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="float">
                    <p>Meanwhile, the ones who had become rich got into the honest man's
                    habit of going to the bridge at night to watch the water flow by
                    beneath. This increased the confusion because it meant lots of others
                    became rich and lots of others became poor.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="float">
                    <p>Now, the rich people saw that if they went to the bridge every night
                    they'd soon be poor. And they thought: 'Let's pay some of the poor
                    to go and rob for us.' They made contracts, fixed salaries,
                    percentages: they were still thieves of course, and they still tried
                    to swindle each other. But, as tends to happen, the rich got richer and
                    richer and the poor got poorer and poorer.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="float">
                    <p>Some of the rich people got so rich that they didn't need to steal or
                    have others steal for them so as to stay rich. But if they stopped
                    stealing they would get poor because the poor stole from them. So
                    they paid the very poorest of the poor to defend their property from
                    the other poor, and that meant setting up a police force and building prisons.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="float">
                    <p>So it was that only a few years after the appearance of the honest man,
                    people no longer spoke of robbing and being robbed, but only of the rich
                    and the poor; but they were still all thieves.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="float">
                    <p>The only honest man had been the one at the beginning, and he died
                    in very short order, of hunger.</p>
